# program to calculate the area of rectangle
'''length=2
breath=3
area=length*breath
print('the are of of rectangle is ',area)'''
'''print('the area of the rectangle is'+str(area)
the above +str is used for using the string with the interger.
f is format where {} is used for it, and also give the value after the {}
eg: print('are of the rectangle is {area}')'''
#input for user
'''length=int(input('enter the length: '))
breadth=int(input('enter the breath: '))
area=length*breadth
print('the are of the rectangle is '+str(area))'''
# area to find area of the circle
pie=(3.14)
radius=int(input('enter the value of radius'))
area=pie*radius**2
print('the area of the circle is ',area)
